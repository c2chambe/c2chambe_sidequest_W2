## Description

Base text: Adds several rectangular platforms. The blob is drawn as a noisy circle but collides using a simple axis-aligned bounding box (AABB). X and Y are resolved separately to keep behaviour predictable and teachable.

Added several new movement mechanics, changed the design of the ball, and added a win condition to the "game"

## Learning Goals

Learning Goals:
From example:

- Convert a circular sprite to an AABB for collision
- Implement overlap test and push-out resolution
- Manage grounded state only when landing on top faces

Personal:
-Program the ball to move in a way the evoques an emotion, and build the environment to reflect that emotion as well.
