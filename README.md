## Description

This game simulates the emotion of helpnessless and fear, in video game form. The object does not represent the player, but the player in an omnipitent being in this game, that is forcing the ball into submission, but the ball refuses to go down without a fight.

The mechanics are simple - use WASD to move the ball Up, Down, Left or Right, but do not be surprised by how long this may take you to complete successfully.

Frustrated? Unnerved? Worried? Guilty? Thats the point. This is your fault. You're a monster.
